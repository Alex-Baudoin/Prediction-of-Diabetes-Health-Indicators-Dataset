# Prediction-of-Diabetes-Health-Indicators-Dataset
The goal is to apply a suitable neural network architecture to the classification problem on the diabetes health indicators dataset.

To improve the performance of the model (We have worked with a deep learning Artificial Neural Network), we have performed our analysis with different appropriate regularization techniques, such as L1, L2, Elastic Net,and dropout, and tune the hyperparameters (number of epochs, number of nodes, batch size, learning rate, etc).

Moreover, with those different type of regularization techniques we have trained our model with three optimizers such as Adam, rmsprop, stochastic gradient descent. The best model in terms of good fit was when the considered two hidden layers with a mix of Early stopping and Adam with a learning rate at 0.0009.
